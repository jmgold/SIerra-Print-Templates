# Minuteman Library Network Due Slips

These templates were updated en masse for the release of Sierra 5.0 in order to take advantage of the updated email and price calculation features.

Each library in the network has their own template, though most only differ in the contents of their headers and footers.

The [default Due slip template](https://github.com/Minuteman-Library-Network/SIerra-Print-Templates/blob/work/Due%20Slips/Date_Due_Slip_50_default.jrxml) produces a slip looking like this:

In the case of [Wellesley](https://github.com/Minuteman-Library-Network/SIerra-Print-Templates/blob/work/Due%20Slips/Wellesley/Date_Due_Slip_40_Column_wel_image.jrxml) this default was edited in a few ways.

* Added a logo to the header
* Removed the patron's name from the slip
* Added a fixed message to the footer
* Centered all text and removed bold formatting

The Ashland library opted to take advantage of the Item_Price_Total field introduced in 5.0.  As an example of that here is [the email form of their template](https://github.com/Minuteman-Library-Network/SIerra-Print-Templates/blob/work/Due%20Slips/Ashland/Date_Due_Slip_50_ash_price_email.jrxml).
