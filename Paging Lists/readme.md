# Minuteman Library Network Paging Lists

These templates were originally created for Sierra 4.2 but are still in use under 5.1.

Title_Paging_List_NTN.jrxml has served as the baseline template for the rest as libraries have wished to emulate that basic design.

The goal of that template was to save as much paper as possible and so the template fits 14 items to a page, each given two lines of text.
