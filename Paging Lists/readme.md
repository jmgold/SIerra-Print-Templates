# Minuteman Library Network Paging Lists

These templates were originally created for Sierra 4.2 but are still in use under 5.2.

We force most holds to be title holds and so the title paging lists are of primary importance, but these can serve as item paging lists as well.

The [default title paging list template](https://github.com/Minuteman-Library-Network/SIerra-Print-Templates/blob/work/Paging%20Lists/Title_Paging_List.jrxml) looks like this:

[Title_Paging_List_NTN.jrxml](https://github.com/Minuteman-Library-Network/SIerra-Print-Templates/blob/work/Paging%20Lists/Title_Paging_List_NTN.jrxml) has served as the baseline template for the rest as libraries have wished to emulate that basic design.

The goal of that template was to save as much paper as possible and so the template fits 14 items to a page, each given two lines of text, resulting in this:

Other templates found here will generally be slight variations on that layout, simply swapping/rearranging some fields or emphasizing others via differing font options.
